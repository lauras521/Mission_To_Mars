# Mission To Mars

## Purpose
Robin does freelance astronomy work in her free time and would like to land a job with Nasa.  She wants to display her knowledge in a website about mars.  She completes a web scrape from multiple different sites to gather data and displays them in her own site.  

A screenshot from the site she created is below:

</p>

## Deliverable 1
Robin scraped the title of the different hemispheres of Mars as well as the URL links from https://marshemispheres.com.  This can be found in the Mission_to_Mars_Challenge.ipynb file.

## Deliverable 2
Robin was able to display the images of the hemispheres on her site as seen above.

## Deliverable 3
Robin used bootstrap elements to change the color of her scraping button to red and to add an image to the background of her jumbotron.  

Robin's site is responsive to mobile devices and other screen sizes.  You can see below how the site changes from the picture above as you change the window width.
